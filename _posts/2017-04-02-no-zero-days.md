title: No Zero Days
---

I just saw a post on reddit that made me rethink my life: Here is what I felt from this article. [Original article from reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/1q96b5/i_just_dont_care_about_myself/)

### Number 1 - *No Zero Days*

A Zero day is when you don't do a single thing towards whatever dream, goal, desire, or longing is. Do something daily.

I really liked this passage about the meaning of a zero day.

> There are no more zero days. What's a zero day? A zero day is when you don't do a single thing towards whatever dream or goal or want or whatever that you got going on. No more zeros. I'm not saying you gotta bust an essay out everyday, that's not the point. The point I'm trying to make is that you have to make yourself, promise yourself, that the new SYSTEM you live in is a NON-ZERO system. Didnt' do anything all day and it's 11:58 PM? Write one sentence. One pushup. Read one page of that chapter. One. Because one is non zero. You feel me? When you're in the super vortex of being bummed your pattern of behaviour is keeping the vortex going, that's what you're used to. Turning into productivity ultimate master of the universe doesn't happen from the vortex. It happens from a massive string of CONSISTENT NON ZEROS. That's rule number one. Do not forget.

So what? For me whether it is music, programming, or family, I felt recommited to try harder each day.

### Number 2 - *BE GRATEFUL TO THE 3 YOU'S*
 * The past you
 * The present you
 * The future you

 Make sure you think about your present self, future self. Get out of bed when your alarm clock goes off. Thomas Edison once said

> "You can often gauge a man's ambition by whether he hates his alarm clock or considers it his best friend."

 Your future self will thank you for doing that hard things. Living in Hachioji, Japan for a season, I came across this quote and I have stuck by this quote since then.

> "if you avoid difficult things, great things will avoid you."
> -- George H. Brimhall

### Number 3 - *Forgive yourself*
You need to forgive yourself, nuff said. We're not perfect but we get credit for trying. Keep trying.

### Number 4 - *Exercise and books*
  Good books to read.
  * emotional intelligence
  * From good to great
  * thinking fast and slow

Read books that will help you understand. Reading is the warp whistle from Super Mario 3. It gets you to the next level that much faster.
